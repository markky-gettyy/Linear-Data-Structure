# Linear-Data-Structure
LabActivity2

 This program is a simple console-based Java application that allows the user to test **basic data structures**:  
- **Stack** (array-based)  
- **Queue** (array-based)  
- **Linked List** (singly)  
- **Circular Linked List**

The user can choose which data structure to work with, and each has its own operations.
