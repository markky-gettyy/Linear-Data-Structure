# Linear-Data-Structure
LabActivity2

 This program is a simple console-based Java application that allows the user to test **basic data structures**:  
- **Stack** (array-based)  
- **Queue** (array-based)  
- **Linked List** (singly)  
- **Circular Linked List**

The user can choose which data structure to work with, and each has its own operations.

## How it works

### Stack
- **Push** → add an element to the top of the stack  
- **Pop** → remove and show the top element  
- **Show** → display stack contents from top to bottom  

### Queue
- **Enqueue** → insert element at the rear  
- **Dequeue** → remove and show the element at the front  
- **Show** → display elements from front to rear  

### Linked List
- **InsertEnd** → add a new node at the end  
- **DelBegin** → delete the first node  
- **Show** → display all nodes in the list  

### Circular Linked List
- **Insert** → add a node at the end, maintaining circular property  
- **Delete** → remove the first node  
- **Show** → display all nodes until it circles back
